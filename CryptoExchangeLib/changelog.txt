Trying a different approach for the core crypto exchange library. This is a significant shift in a few
key areas. Namely, less reliance on generics, generated json classes, and reflection.

This should end up being a good deal cleaner, though its a work in progress at the moment.

All public API calls and most private API calls should work just fine for both Cryptopia and Bittrex.
