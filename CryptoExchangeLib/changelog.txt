Trying a different approach for the core crypto exchange library. This is a significant shift in a few
key areas. Namely, less reliance on generics, generated json classes, and reflection.

This should end up being a good deal cleaner, though its a work in progress at the moment.

All public API calls and most private API calls should work just fine for both Cryptopia and Bittrex. 

TODO: It might be worthwhile to whip up a webclient class that better encapsulates the private API calls.
Its kind of a mess the way it is now.

Its worth noting that I purposely avoided doing async/await calls, which actually took some doing to get worked out.
The only reason for this is that it is a damned nightmare to debug. I may add a separate async namespace back as 
I get each exchange more or less debugged. It _IS_ a lot cleaner, but not a huge priority at the moment.
